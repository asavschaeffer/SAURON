# SAURON - Ultra-lightweight requirements
# No external dependencies required!
# 
# The beauty of SAURON is that it uses only Python standard library:
# - re (regex for parsing)
# - time (timestamps)
# - threading (input monitoring)
# - sys (stdin handling)  
# - select (non-blocking input)
# - random (combat randomness)
# - dataclasses (Python 3.7+)
# - enum (gesture types)
# - typing (type hints)
#
# Minimum Python version: 3.7
# 
# This means SAURON can run on:
# ✅ Raspberry Pi Zero ($5)
# ✅ Old smartphones with Termux  
# ✅ Embedded Linux devices
# ✅ Retro computers from the 1990s
# ✅ Literally any device with Python 3.7+
#
# Total memory footprint: ~10MB
# CPU requirements: Negligible
# Storage: ~50KB for source code
#
# The most portable game controller framework ever built!
